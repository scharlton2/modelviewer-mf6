Zooming, Rotation, and Panning
==============================

MvMf6 displays an object as viewed from a particular viewpoint. Zooming, rotation, and panning are different ways to interact with the object by changing the viewpoint.

- Zooming in moves the viewpoint closer to the object being viewed, causing the object to appear bigger.
- Zooming out moves the viewpoint away from the object being viewed, causing the object to appear smaller.
- Rotation moves the viewpoint in an angular direction so that the viewed object appears to rotate.
- Panning moves the viewpoint laterally so that the viewed object appears to move sideways.

Zooming, rotation, and panning are performed by mouse buttons. Two types of mouse interactions are provided:

- trackball-mode interaction
- joystick-mode interaction

Trackball-mode interaction is the default. However, the user may change the interaction mode from one to the other.

First, put the cursor inside the display area. Then:

- To **zoom in**, press and hold the **right** mouse button, and drag the cursor upward.
- To **zoom out**, press and hold the **right** mouse button, and drag the cursor downward.
- To **rotate**, press and hold the **left** mouse button, and drag the cursor in the direction of rotation.
- To **rotate around an axis perpendicular to the screen**, hold down the **Ctrl** key, press and hold the **left** mouse button, and drag the cursor in the direction of rotation.
- To **pan**, hold down the **Shift** key, press and hold the **left** mouse button, and drag the cursor in the direction of panning.

Joystick-Mode Interaction
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

In joystick-mode interaction, the speed and direction of zooming, rotation, and panning are determined by the position of the cursor relative to the center of the display area. 

- When the cursor is far from the center, interaction is faster. 
- When the cursor is near the center of the display area, interaction is slower. 
- To **zoom in**, place the cursor on the upper half of the display area, then press and hold the **right** mouse button. To end zooming, release the button. 
- To **zoom out**, place the cursor on the lower half of the display area, then press and hold the **right** mouse button. To end zooming, release the button. 
- To **rotate**, place the cursor such that its position relative to the display area center indicates the direction of rotation, then press and hold the **left** mouse button. To end rotation, release the button. 
- To **rotate around an axis perpendicular to the screen**, place the cursor such that its position relative to the display area center indicates the direction of rotation, then press and hold the **Ctrl** key and left mouse button. To end rotation, release the button. 
- To **pan**, place the cursor such that its position relative to the display area center indicates the direction of panning, hold down the **Shift** key, then press and hold the **left** mouse button. To end panning, release the button.
